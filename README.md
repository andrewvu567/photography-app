# photography-app

A WebApp designed to be a resource for photographers and customers alike. Our web application matches clients with photographers and allows them to schedule photography sessions. Includes Google Calendar feature platform and email notifications of when a client is interested in a photographer. 

**The Problem**
  - It is difficult for photographers to keep track of clients and also reach out to new clients to schedule sessions. Our website will consolidate this       process into one convenient location while also notifying clients and photographers of session times and dates.
  - It is difficult as a customer to know the type and length of photography service they might need. Our website will streamline this by enabling             customers to select their preferences and be matched with the appropriate photographer and service for their needs. 

**Major Features**
  - The application will allow clients and photographers to match with one another based on the client’s needs and photographer’s experience.
  - The application will allow clients and photographers to schedule sessions once matched by linking to one calendar.
  - The application will notify clients when they are matched and of any upcoming sessions that they have booked.
  - The application will allow clients to cancel their session at any time up to 48 hours before their session.
